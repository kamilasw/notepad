# notepad
project using windows forms

initial idea was to create a to do list (thus files are called todolist) - got side tracked and made notes instead.
- it has a textbox to input text, a button to add it to the note, note display textbox, and a button to clear the note and pretty colors 

another options:
- ENTER also adds the text
- display error without loosing wrong input ( now when the text is larger than textbox it deletes it and displays the error message there / same for empty but its not as annoying)
- when the note is cleared by reaching the end of it - store the data in a text file
  .. sth else will probably also need fixing
